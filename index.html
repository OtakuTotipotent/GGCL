                    1974, the college added courses for B.Sc in Botany and Zoology. The master's programs in Urdu and
                    Islamic studies were
                    started in 1986 in the newly constructed Postgraduate block of the college. In 1989, the college
                    added master classes in
                    English, Mathematics, and Physics.BS 4-year degree program in English, Urdu, Physics, Math,
                    Chemistry, and Botany was
                    started in 2019 under the affiliation of BZU Multan. BS-Islamiat and BS-IT were added in 2020 and
                    2021, respectively, to
                    the list of BS 4-year degree programs.

                <h3>Principal's Message</h3>
                <p>
                    I heartily welcome you to the Government Graduate College Layyah. Indeed, you have it in mind to
                    join this prestigious
                    institution to outfit yourself with quality education, and no doubt your decision is worth it as it
                    is the proper place;
                    a vibrant back-drop to allow you to show your talent dandily with a plume in your cap. Such
                    educational institutions
                    earn the prestige of society at large as they have a long historical tradition in their chest. The
                    Government Graduate
                    College Layyah is one institution that rightly boasts of its traditions. An educational institution
                    always plays an
                    essential role in carving a road map to determine the future course of society. In this competitive
                    age, we need to
                    improve ourselves, and in a short period, we plan to introduce some progressive discipline in the
                    college, and we are
                    thinking of starting a new domain soon to provide a congenial milieu to brace our students to face
                    the challenges of new
                    technical/information era. But it all needs your sincerity, hard work, honesty, your courage to
                    learn, and your fiery
                    spirit to pose questions “to doubt all philosophies of the world.” I am sure of the fact that you
                    have all the said
                    qualities because you are the best. May God be with you.
